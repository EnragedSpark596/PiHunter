In high school math we approximated pi to 22/7 for ease of calculation. Years later, I became curious about whether there was a better rational fraction for approximating pi
To explore this idea, I created a list of prime numbers to use as denominators, then for each, I looked for a corresponding numerator that best approximated pi.
Given that the exercise is open ended, with an unlimited number of prime numbers that can be tested as suitable denominators, the most important lesson I learned is when to stop looking.

The best ratio I found was 626443/199403, which gave an error (~1e-10) too small to be seen on a hand-held electronic calculator.
The above result came after several iterations of the process. Ultimately I learned that the reduction in error decreased with increasing denominator magnitude, which, coupled with the size of the denominator led me to conclude the exercise was not worth persuing any further.
